MathWiki,What is the definition of an Exact Sequence?,"Let $G_1,\dots,G_n$ be groups. A sequence $G_1\to G_2\to\cdots\to G_n$ of homomorphisms $\phi_i:G_i\to G_{i+1}$ is said to beexact if $\im\phi_i=\ker\phi_{i+1}$ for all $i$. A short exact sequence is an exact sequence $1\to A\overset{\phi}{\to}B\overset{\psi}{\to}C\to1$; that is, a sequence for which $\phi$ is injective, $\psi$ is surjective, and $\im\phi=\ker\psi$. A long exact sequence is an exact sequence that is not short.",0,4,0,3,3,2,8,1,8
